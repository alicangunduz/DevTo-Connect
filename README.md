# DevTo-Connect


This project allows you to build a blog using the dev.to API and Next.js, and deploy it to a custom domain. This means you can have a fully functional blog with all the features of dev.to, but with your own branding and domain name.



## How to set it up


 1. Log in or create a Vercel account if you have one
 2. Fork the project
 3. Click add new project in Vercel
 4. Select the project you forked
 5. Go to dev.to, go to settings, then extensions, then create an api key from the bottom
 6. Define your Environment Variables API_KEY and DATE_FORMAT variables in vercel
 7. Click on the buy deploy button
 8. The blog is now ready! ðŸ¥³
